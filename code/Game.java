        /* ABOUT TESTING.
         * Testing is difficult using a JUnit testing class because it is difficult to
         * get at many of the fields and methods from that class. So you may want to
         * put some testing methods in this class Game.
         * 
         * In testing various methods, you may want to use boards with certain
         * layouts of your choosing. For example, a board with column 0 all filled.
         * To do this, you can
         * 
         *     1. Create a board b
         *     2. Call makeMove several times to put pieces where you want them.
         *     3. Play the game.
         *     
         * For example, you can write the following to set up an initial board and
         * then play the game
         * 
         *      Board b= new Board();
         *      b.makeMove(new Move(Board.Player.RED, 4));
         *      b.makeMove(new Move(Board.Player.YELLOW, 3));
         *      b.makeMove(new Move(Board.Player.RED, 5));
         *      Game game= new Game(p1, p2, b, false);
         * 
         * This code places a red piece in column 4, a yellow piece in column 3,
         * and a red piece in column 5. Then it runs the game.
         * 
         * We give you also procedure fillColumn at the end of this file to help
         * out in initializing a board. Study it. Note that it is static.
         * 
         * Suppose you want to test a method that your wrote, like Board.getPossibleMoves.
         * Thus, you want to do the following.
         * 
         *     1. Create a board b
         *     2. Call makeMove several times to put pieces where you want them.
         *     3. Call the method you want to test.
         *     4. Check the result, if any.
         *     
         * You can check the result by using println statements to print out things and
         * looking at the output. You are testing by eyeballing the output. This is OK as
         * long as you are careful. Here is how you could print out the results of a
         * call to getPossibleMoves:
         * 
         *      Board b= new Board();
         *      fillColumn(b, Board.Player.RED, 0);  // fill column 0
         *      Move[] moves= b.getPossibleMoves(Board.Player.RED);
         *      for (Move m : moves) {
         *           System.out.println(m);
         *
         * If you are having real trouble, the above may not help. Here is what you
         * can do to test the very basics of Board.getPossibleMoves:
         * 
         *      Board b= new Board();
         *      fillColumn(b, Board.Player.RED, 0);  // fill column 0
         *      Move[] moves= b.getPossibleMoves(Board.Player.RED);
         *      if (moves.length != Board.NUM_COLS-1) {
         *          System.out.println("Error in getPossibleMoves with 1 col filled. array size is wrong: " +  moves.length);
         *      }
         *      if (moves[0].getColumn() != 1) {
         *          System.out.println(s + "First col is filled, second isn't but moves[0] is " + moves[0]);
         *      } 
         *      
         * We suggest you write a static method in class main to test getPossibleMoves 
         * (and perhaps other methods for other tests).
         * Make it a method so that you can call it or not from method main, depending on
         * your needs. It doen't have to test ALL possible cases, but it has to check
         * enough that so you are positive the method works.
         * 
         * 
        }
         *
