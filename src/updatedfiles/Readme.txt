Project: Connect 4 Learning ReadmeTeam 4:       Sean ClarkThomas Coppola       Anthony Fontanetta       Sanjana ThomasExplanation of Files:Board.java:	Class file that defines the board representation of a connect four game board. 
Implements the logic for the game rules and win conditions.DatabasePlayer.java:	Agent that plays based on the database built. 
If the agent doesn’t have knowledge of a certain game configuration then it plays randomly.Experience.java:	Implements functions that interface with the knowledge database. 
Used primarily to update the database when running the builder option.GUI.java	The main class that runs a connect 4 game. 
Runs a graphical version of connect four. 
Used when running the game after building the database. 
Has the option of running games between human, minimax, random, and database game players.GamePanel.java	Handles the animation and the graphics of the connect four game.	Human.java	Implements a solver for human players.Minimax.java	Implements the minimax solver.Move.java	An object that represents a player move. 
Holds information on which player and what column a move is to be made in.RandomPlayer.java	Implements a solver that plays randomlyRunnerOption/Game.java	Version of the Game file used to run the game after building the database only.Solver.java	An interface that specifies the getMoves method which is used to return the 
move the player wishes to make to the game board. All players must implement this interface 
in order to play.State.java	Represents the game state. Keeps track of the board the last move made, 
and the current player to move.dbBuilder/Game.java
	Version of the Game that runs while building the files for the database.Compilation:Option one - Building the database:
Move the Game.java in the dbBuilder folder in with the rest of the java files.Run javac *.java in the directory of the java files.Before running the program make a folder named “BoardStates” in the directory that you will be running the project from.Option two – Running after the database has been built:Move the Game.java in the RunnerOption folder in with the rest of the java files.Run javac *.java in the directory of the java files.Before running the program make a folder named “BoardStates” in the directory that you will be running the project from.Running:Option One:Run java GUI   - Select the option for minimax vs minimax.   - To build an adequate database this may have to be run for a long time.Option Two:Run java GUI- Select the combination to player that you want to play using the commandline interface.- Observe the results.- If you selected human option then you may make moves by clicking on the buttons.
